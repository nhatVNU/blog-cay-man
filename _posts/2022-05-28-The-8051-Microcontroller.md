15. A 4-bit DIP switch and a common-anode 7-segment LED are 
connected to an 8051 as shown in the following figure. Write a 
program that continually reads a 4-bit code from the DIP switch and 
updates the LEDs to display the appropriate hexadecimal character. 
For example, if the code 1100B is read, the hexadecimal character 
“C” should appear, thus, segments a through g respectively should 
be ON, OFF, OFF, ON, ON, ON, and OFF. Note that setting an 8051 
port pin to “1” turns the corresponding segment “ON”.
